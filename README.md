# Icewind-Dale-Enhanced-Edition-Reborn
Lore-breaking reimagination of Icewind Dale with new items, item abilities, quests, NPCs, bounties, and armor-set bonuses.

## Introduction
My childhood was in the late eighties and nineties and I grew up with some incredible games from Sega, Nintendo, MS-DOS, not to mention some cartoons and other media. As such, I took great inspiration from these, so great that I referenced these and incorporated them into this mod. These include names, animations, icons, voices, and music from various sources (see [Credits](https://github.com/peteSmith1229/Icewind-Dale-Enhanced-Edition-Reborn/edit/main/README.md#credits)).
Here are some of the main aspects of the mod: 

- A whole range of new items
