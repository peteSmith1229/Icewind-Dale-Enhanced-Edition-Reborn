# Icewind-Dale-Enhanced-Edition-Reborn
Lore-breaking reimagination of Icewind Dale with new items, item abilities, quests, NPCs, bounties, and armor-set bonuses. All new in-game texts are coloured to help players easily see new conversations (blue), responses (yellow) or descriptions (green/red).

## Introduction
My childhood was in the late eighties and nineties and I grew up with some incredible games from Sega, Nintendo, MS-DOS, not to mention some cartoons and other media. As such, I took great inspiration from these, so great that I referenced these and incorporated them into this mod. These include names, animations, icons, voices, and music from various sources (see [Credits](https://github.com/peteSmith1229/Icewind-Dale-Enhanced-Edition-Reborn/edit/main/README.md#credits)).
Here are some of the main aspects of the mod: 

- A whole range of new items, weapons, and armor

 - A weaponsmith to teach you new proficiency

 - New Alchemy system where finding and combining rare ingredients will award you with new spells (ingredients spawn on the map where the Ranger's Tracking ability can help locate)

 - New weapon abilities which can only be activated when wielding the weapon itself

 - New Bounty system where bringing evidence will give you rewards, in addition to being able to purchase a home where you can store your items inside safely and rest whenever you wish

## Recommended Party
This mod is designed for vanilla classes where each class has been revamped in terms of weapon proficiency (e.g. a Thief can gain Grand Mastery (5 points) in Daggers and Short Swords). These changes are highlighted during the Character Creation stage
